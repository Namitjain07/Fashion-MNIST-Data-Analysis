# Fashion-MNIST Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a dataset of grayscale images representing various clothing items. The goal is to perform preprocessing, visualization, and classification of the data. The notebook demonstrates essential machine learning workflows, including data handling, normalization, feature visualization, and model evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains:
- **Training set:** 60,000 images.
- **Test set:** 10,000 images.

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, categorized into one of 10 classes:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## Features of the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the training and test datasets from CSV files.
   - Normalizing the pixel values to scale them between 0 and 1.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Displaying 10 samples from the test dataset with their corresponding labels.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Training a machine learning model to classify the images.
   - Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Libraries Used**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `scikit-learn` for machine learning and evaluation.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset:
   - Ensure `fashion-mnist_train.csv` and `fashion-mnist_test.csv` are in the project directory.

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook namit.ipynb
   ```

5. Follow the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

## Results
- The notebook evaluates the classification model and provides:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
  - Visualization of sample images

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Explore data augmentation techniques to enhance training.
- Visualize feature maps of convolutional layers (if using a CNN).
